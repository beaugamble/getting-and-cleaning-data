## Overview

This project aims to demonstrate the collection, cleaning, and tidying of a data set to be used for analysis. A complete description of the data used in this project is available at [The UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).

The source data can be found [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).

## Project Instructions

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The end result can be found in the file `meansTidyData.txt`.

## Additional Information

Additional information about the variables, data and transformations can be found in the `CodeBook.md file`.
